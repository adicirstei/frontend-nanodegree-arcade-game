Usage
-----

In order to play the game you need to download the repository and serve the index.html through a web server.

There are several options. I like to use python's `SimpleHTTPServer` because it comes free with python and do not require any configuration.

Here are my steps to download the code and serve it from a local server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adicirstei/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git
cd frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

This should start a web server on localhost port 8000. Go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) and have fun!
